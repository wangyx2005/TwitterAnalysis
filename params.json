Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Weekly updates\r\n###### Week 0\r\n* generated proposal, presentation, make the project page on GitHub\r\n* Played with IBM Bluemix a little bit. Bluemix is indeed a powerful tool. And if we do not need to perform the analysis on-fly, we should just use Bluemix. However, because the free trial account on Bluemix has strict limitation on the usage of Apache Spark and the trial account can only access 1 month, we decided we will not use Bluemix as the main part of our project. However, we may use it as a complement of our project.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYuxing Wang @wangyx2005, Jing Cui @Jingcui01 Zhenying Tao @Shally1103\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n",
